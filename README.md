 Overview
This project applies statistical methods to analyze paper strength test results across different batches and production processes. It uses SciPy and Pandas to perform hypothesis testing, calculate confidence intervals, and interpret key metrics to ensure product quality and process improvements.

🎯 Objectives
Assess whether paper batches meet required strength specifications

Compare strength measurements across different processes or machines

Determine if process modifications lead to statistically significant improvements

Evaluate consistency and reliability of testing methods

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

SciPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📂 Dataset
paper_strength_data.csv

Contains strength measurements including:

Batch_ID

Process_Type or Machine_ID

Tensile_Strength

Tear_Strength

Burst_Strength

🔧 Setup Instructions
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
Place the paper_strength_data.csv in your project directory.

Run the analysis notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

⚙️ Features
Descriptive Statistics
Summary stats for strength properties by batch/process.

Hypothesis Testing

t-tests to compare means between groups

ANOVA for multi-group comparison

Confidence Intervals
Estimate 95% confidence intervals for key metrics.

Visualization
Boxplots and histograms to show distribution and variation.

Process Evaluation
Identify which process or batch underperforms and why.

📊 Sample Code Snippet
python
Copy
Edit
from scipy import stats

# Compare two process types
group1 = df[df['Process_Type'] == 'A']['Tensile_Strength']
group2 = df[df['Process_Type'] == 'B']['Tensile_Strength']

# Perform t-test
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)

print("T-Statistic:", t_stat)
print("P-Value:", p_val)
📈 Expected Output
Summary tables for each strength metric

Plots comparing strength by batch/process

Hypothesis test results with interpretation

Confidence intervals on mean strength

Recommendations for improving or standardizing process

🚀 Future Enhancements
Include more strength metrics (e.g., stiffness, porosity)

Automate outlier detection and removal

Add control charts for SPC (Statistical Process Control)

Build a dashboard summarizing batch-level performance
